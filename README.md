### 5.1 ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ AI ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏Ñ‡∏¥‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏¢ | Idea Generation
```markdown
Prompt ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ: "I want to develop a cookie clicker like application game where users can click to generate money and use to buy upgrades. What kind of theme should I use and what differences I should make for the app to stand out"

‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏•‡∏±‡∏û‡∏ò‡πå:  
The AI helps to list different themes and ideas for me to choose
```

### 5.2 ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ AI ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö UI | UI Layout Prompt
```markdown
Prompt ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ:  
"Create a very simple cookie-clicker-like mobile application using purely javascript. Where instead of cookies it will be space themed and clicking on planets. Include an upgrade screen and stats screen where the upgrades screen will have an additional feature to upgrade planet tiers. Make sure that all the dependencies are latest versions and SDK is latest version and expo is latest version. Make sure the application will be ready for eas build --platform android. I have attached the planet png files."

‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏•‡∏±‡∏û‡∏ò‡πå:  
I got a working simplified version of the app with 4 screens: the home screen, upgrades screen, stats screen, and about section screen
```

### 5.3 ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ AI ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏î | Code Writing Prompt
```markdown
Prompt ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ:  
"Implement a chest function on the upgrades tab to where users are able to purchase a chest with currency, watch ads, or by upgrading a planet. These chests will contain hats where it cosmetically decorates the planets and will bounce with the planets when the user clicks."

‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏•‡∏±‡∏û‡∏ò‡πå:  
Added the function but with some bugs and issues.
```

### 5.4 ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ AI ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢ debug | Debug Prompt
```markdown
Prompt ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ:  
"The chest function works correctly however the hats are having trouble displaying on the planets, please modify and resolve the issue to simply display the hat positioned slightly on top of the planet and make it correctly bounce in sync with the planet"

‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏•‡∏±‡∏û‡∏ò‡πå:  
AI correctly displays the hat but doesn't position it correctly, I manually fixed the positioning to make it display slightly on top of the planet correctly.
```

### 5.5 ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ AI ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢ Deploy | Deployment Prompt
```markdown
Prompt ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ:  
"Prepare my application to be ready to build APK on expo.dev please give a list of instructions to make this possible with minimal issues."

‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏•‡∏±‡∏û‡∏ò‡πå:  
AI gives eas build --platform android --profile preview command showing detailed guides to proceed.
```
